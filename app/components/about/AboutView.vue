            I started my career in 2015 as a Graphic Designer, shaping visual identities and creating both digital and
            print
            assets across a range of mediums. I also spent a year studying graphic design in Czechia and later worked
            for
            nearly five years at a major e-commerce company, where I was responsible for UI banners, print materials,
            and
            motion graphics.

            <p class="font-black text-primary">Front-End Development</p>
            In 2022, I transitioned into Front-End Development to merge my design roots with a growing passion for
            building
            clean, engaging user interfaces. Now based in Ankara, I focus on creating responsive, accessible, and
            visually
            refined web applications.

            <p class="font-black text-primary">Current Focus & Goals</p>
            With a strong foundation in visual design and a solid grasp of modern frontend tools like React, Next.js,
            and
            Tailwind CSS, I aim to bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality—crafting user experiences that
            are
            not only beautiful but also intuitive, performant, and scalable.
